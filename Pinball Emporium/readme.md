# First Time install
+ Run the **INSTALLER.bat** located in the *_INSTALLER* Folder and follow the direction carefully.
+ At any point you need to change something, exit the program/cmd and start over.
# Info & FAQ
## If your playfield is upside-down
1. Right-click on the desktop and choose "Display Settings".
2. Scroll down to "Display orientation" and change 'Landscape' to 'Landscape flipped'.
## Including & Excluding Tables from the List
+ Because all tables are included whether you own them or not (FX, FX3 & Zaccaria), you may remove them from the menu list manually.
+ If you would rather they not appear in the menu list. Edit or add the "exclude.txt" or "include.txt" file in the collections folders.
(ex: PinballEmporium\collections\Pinball FX3\exclude.txt)
